# Colab Adaptations of GitHub Projects

## Introduction

This repository contains Google Colab adaptations of two innovative projects to facilitate easier usage among friends and colleagues. The adaptations were created following the original instructions provided by the respective repositories, ensuring the integrity and functionality are maintained.

### Projects Adapted

1. **txt2imghd**: A project originally designed for generating detailed, higher-resolution images using a variant of the Stable Diffusion model called GOBIG, with an additional upscaling step using Real-ESRGAN. It's particularly useful for creating enhanced visual content from textual prompts.

   - **Original Repository**: [txt2imghd](https://github.com/jquesnelle/txt2imghd)
   - **Description**: The txt2imghd tool, following the methodology from progrockdiffusion, facilitates the generation of detailed images by scaling up an initial output and refining it through subsequent img2img processes.
   - **Google Colab Link**: [txt2imghd Colab Notebook]([https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jydtGFnwMR6fYSek6J7d8iyrjDltoILN?usp=drive_open#scrollTo=XPhAfvCW-IcG))

2. **Estimating and Exploiting the Aleatoric Uncertainty in Surface Normal Estimation**: A robust method for estimating surface normal uncertainties in imaging, which helps in improving the precision of depth perception in various computer vision applications.

   - **Original Repository**: [surface_normal_uncertainty](https://github.com/baegwangbin/surface_normal_uncertainty)
   - **Description**: This project introduces a novel approach to quantify and leverage aleatoric uncertainty in the estimation of surface normals, enhancing the accuracy and detail of the predictions.
   - **Google Colab Link**: [Surface Normal Uncertainty Colab Notebook]([https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HLjJORchZvzIdl8Mr_mXMYOr7-rhQygW?usp=drive_open#scrollTo=_MAEOIPQRnA2))

## Purpose of This Adaptation

The primary goal of these adaptations is to simplify the setup and execution process, making these advanced technologies more accessible for personal and collaborative educational purposes. The Colab notebooks are configured to handle dependencies and environment setup automatically, allowing users to focus on experimenting with the technology rather than configuration details.

## How to Use

To use these adaptations, follow the steps below:

1. **Access the Notebook**: Click on the Colab links provided in each project's directory.
2. **Run the Cells**: Execute the notebook cells sequentially to set up the environment and start the application.
3. **Explore**: Modify the input parameters as needed to experiment with different outputs and functionalities.

## Acknowledgments

All credit for the original creation and development of the technologies goes to the authors of the respective projects. This adaptation is merely a reformatting to ease the use within the Colab environment, and all significant scientific contributions and original coding were done by the original authors.
